<h2>Revealed: The Career Paths of 100 Successful CEOs</h2>  
<p>What does it take to reach the top of the corporate ladder? A recent study analyzed the career trajectories of 100 highly successful CEOs to uncover common patterns and insights. The findings reveal that while there's no single "right" path, certain trends stand out.</p>  

<p>Surprisingly, only 35% of CEOs followed a traditional linear progression within one company. The majority (65%) switched industries or roles at least once, highlighting the value of diverse experiences. Many CEOs also spent time in operational roles early in their careers, gaining hands-on leadership experience.</p>  

<p>Education played a significant role, with 82% holding advanced degrees (MBAs being most common). However, 18% of CEOs reached the top without any graduate education, proving that real-world experience can sometimes outweigh formal qualifications.</p>  

<p>The study also found that international experience correlated strongly with success - 60% of CEOs had worked abroad at some point in their careers. This suggests that global perspective is increasingly valuable in today's interconnected business world.</p>  

<p>While the paths varied, one common thread emerged: successful CEOs consistently sought challenging assignments that pushed them outside their comfort zones. As one CEO put it, "Growth happens at the edges of what you know."</p>
